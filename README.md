# Placement Training Questions

Welcome to the Placement Training Questions repository! This repository is dedicated to helping individuals prepare for placement interviews by providing a comprehensive collection of questions. These questions cover both coding and non-coding topics that I have encountered during various selection rounds or while preparing for them.

## What's Inside

This repository includes:

- **Coding Questions:** A wide range of programming challenges, data structures, and algorithm-related problems commonly asked in technical interviews.
  
- **Non-Coding Questions:** Interview questions related to soft skills, aptitude, logic, system design, HR questions, and more, which are essential for the non-technical rounds.
  
- **Resources:** Links to helpful resources, such as tutorials, reference materials, and other useful guides for placement preparation.
  
- **Solutions:** Where applicable, I've also included solutions to coding problems to help you understand the approach and improve your problem-solving skills.


## How to Use

1. **Explore the Coding Questions:** Start practicing with the coding questions categorized by difficulty level or topic.
2. **Review Non-Coding Sections:** Prepare for aptitude, HR, and other interview questions.
3. **Contribute:** If youâ€™ve come across interesting placement questions, feel free to contribute to this repository!
