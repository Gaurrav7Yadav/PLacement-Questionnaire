The map contains islands, named from Island 1 to Island N For any two islands Island / and Island J (Iâ‰ J), you can go to Island Jfrom Island / only if the value / divides J. (I is a divisor of J. Given the value for the last island, equal to N, find the number of ways to reach Island N from the first Island, that is, Island 1
Find the number of ways to reach Island N from Island 1.

CODE:

def count_ways(N):
    # Create an array to store the number of ways to reach each island
    ways = [0] * (N + 1)
    
    # Base case
    ways[1] = 1
    
    # Fill the ways array using the described method
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        for j in range(i, N + 1, i):
            ways[j] += ways[i]
    
    return ways[N]

# Example usage
N = 9
print(count_ways(N))  # Output the number of ways to reach Island 9
